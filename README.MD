Project Title:
Java War Card Game

Project description goes here

War is a card game for two players. A standard deck of 52 cards is dealt so that both players have 26 cards. During
each round of play (or "battle"), both players play a card from the top of their hand face up. The player who plays
the card of the higher rank wins both cards and places them at the bottom of his stack of cards. If both cards played
are of the same rank, then both players play three additional cards face down and then one more card face up (this is
called a "war"). The player who wins the war by playing the higher card wins all ten cards. If the ranks are still the
same, additional wars are played until one player wins the turn. If either player runs out of cards to play, he loses
the game.
